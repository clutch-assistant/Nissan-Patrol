    description: "The Nissan Patrol Y62 marked a major evolution in the legendary Patrol SUV lineage when it debuted in 2010, transitioning the model from utilitarian off‑roader to a premium full‑size SUV with enhanced on‑road refinement while retaining strong off‑road capability. Built on a traditional ladder‑frame chassis with modern independent suspension, the Y62 emphasized comfort, luxury, and towing performance alongside robust 4WD systems. Initial powertrain offerings included a naturally aspirated 4.0‑liter V6 and — more significantly — a 5.6‑liter VK56VD V8 engine producing around 400 horsepower and 560 Nm of torque paired with a seven‑speed automatic transmission, providing a blend of smooth power delivery and strong towing capacity. Over its long production run, the Y62 consistently received updates to technology, infotainment, and safety systems while keeping its commanding presence and rugged capability. This generation also underpinned derivative models such as the Infiniti QX56/QX80 luxury SUV and the North American Nissan Armada, expanding Patrol’s global footprint. The Y62’s combination of robust off‑road hardware, refined interior appointments, and dependable V8 performance solidified its place as a flagship SUV in markets from the Middle East to Australia and beyond, maintaining the Patrol’s reputation for durability and versatility across diverse conditions.":contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
